Non-fungible Token Item
=======================

Create non fungible token required approval from authorities.

------

Creating Instances
------------------
:sup:`NonFungibleTokenItem` . create ( properties, signerOrProvider ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<NonFungibleTokenItem>`
    Creates a new instance reference from *signerOrProvider* and send non fungible token item creation transaction to network
    and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a NonFungibleTokenItem instance.

    The valid non-fungible token properties are:

        - **name** --- the unique non-fungible token name
        - **symbol** --- the unique non-fungible token symbol
        - **fee** --- the application fee
        - **owner** --- the owner for the non-fungible token (default to wallet creator)
        - **properties** --- properties of the non-fungible token
        - **metadata** --- optional

:sup:`NonFungibleTokenItem` . fromSymbol ( symbol, signerOrProvider ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<NonFungibleTokenItem>`
    Query non-fungible token by symbol from network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that 
    resolves to a NonFungibleToken instance.

-----

Prototype
---------

:sup:`prototype` . state |nbsp| `=> TokenState`
    The valid token state are:

        - **type** --- the token type (fungible, or non-fungible)
        - **name** --- the unique token name
        - **symbol** --- the unique token symbol
        - **decimals** --- the number of decimals for balance
        - **fixedSupply** --- the supply mechanisms type (``true``: fixed, ``false``: dynamic)
        - **totalSupply** --- the total current supply for the token
        - **maxSupply** --- the maximum supply for the token
        - **approved** --- the approval status
        - **frozen** --- the frozen status
        - **owner** --- the token owner address
        - **metadata** --- optional
        - **burnable** --- the token balance allow to be burn or not. This will be always true for dynamic supply token.


:sup:`prototype` . getParent() |nbsp| `=> Non-fungible Token<NonFungibleToken>`
    *Get parent* of the non-fungible token. 

:sup:`prototype` . transferOwnership ( :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>` ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Sends the *transfer non-fungible token item* to another person and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.


:sup:`prototype` . mint ( :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>`) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Sends the *mint non-fungible token item transaction* to the network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.

    The :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>` can be set to recipient alias or wallet address. 

:sup:`prototype` . burn ( value ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Sends the *burn non-fungible token item transaction* to the network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.

    The ``value`` is the number of *non-fungible token item* (as a :ref:`BigNumber <bignumber>`) that to be burned.
    Be aware of the number of decimals applied for the token.

:sup:`prototype` . freeze ( :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>` ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Sends the *freeze non-fungible token item transaction* to the network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.

    The :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>` can be set to target holder alias or wallet address that to be freeze.

.. note:: Only non-fungible token item middleware is allowed to sign ``freeze`` transaction.

:sup:`prototype` . unfreeze ( :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>` ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Sends the *unfreeze non-fungible token transaction* to the network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.

    The :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>` can be set to target holder alias or wallet address that to be unfreeze.

.. note:: Only non-fungible token item middleware is allowed to sign ``unfreeze`` transaction.

:sup:`prototype` . endorse( ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Perform endorsement by endorser

:sup:`prototype` . updateMetadata(metadata) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Update the *metadata of non-fungible token item* to the network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>`













Currently no place to stay so it stay here 


Name Service
############

:sup:`prototype` . createAlias ( name, appFee ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Sign alias creation transaction and send it to network and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to a
    :ref:`Transaction Response <transaction-receipt>`. Alias application approval is required by authority.


    Note: The alias should not contains any spaces, special characters or any sensitive words.
    The application fee should be set according to the configured value.
